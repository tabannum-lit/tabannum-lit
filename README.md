Hello! 

I am Tasneem Tabannum (she/her).

So if you want to know about my interest, I can say I am not intereested in anything at the same time I am interested in everything as well. How is that? Because I love to learn new things but I also lose interest so quickly about anything. I know I know consistency is the key, but can't help. After all I am a human being not some git AI.
